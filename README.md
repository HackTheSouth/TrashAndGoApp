# TrashAndGoApp
The front-end of the TrashAndGo app was built entirely using Android Studio (Java and XML).
* Used Google Maps to display a map on the app, and added custom markers (bins) to the map, retrieved via GET requests to the Server.
* The app made use of the phones camera to take a photo, which would then be sent to the server via a POST request.
* It also awarded users for putting litter in bins through a point system, which they could also exchange for store/restaurant vouchers.

The front-end was developed by Josh (josh-hook), Leo (L-Gamble), Akhilesh (as14g18) and Ben (bt1g18).

Update, the app won second place in HackTheSouth
